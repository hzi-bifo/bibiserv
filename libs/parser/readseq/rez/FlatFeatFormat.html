<HTML><TITLE>Readseq: FlatFeatFormat</TITLE><BODY> ------  FFF - FlatFeat - Flattened Feature Format  -----------<P>      This is essentially the <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/collab/FT/">DDBJ/GenBank/EMBL Feature Table</A> specificationwith newlines and extra space removed, to produce single-line featureentries which can more efficiently be indexed and read by software.Basic FFF format is a tab-separated-value file, with these columns:Key    Location   Qualifiers<PRE># flatfeat-version 2Key Location  Qualifierssource  1..1684   /organism="Drosophila melanogaster" ;/chromosome="3L" ; /map="69C" ; /ACCESSION="U57488" ...gene  18..1684  /gene="est-6"CDS join(18..1404,1456..&gt;1684)  /gene="est-6" ;...exon  18..1404  /gene="est-6"intron  1405..1455  /gene="est-6"exon  1456..&gt;1684 /gene="est-6"</PRE>Similar to GFF, FFF works better for me as it contains all informationabout a feature in one row.  GFF splits gene, mRNA, other multi-locationfeatures among several rows, and currently lacks a standard syntax for groupingthese feature parts.<p>     Readseq treats FFF as a general tab-separated-value file with the first non-comment (#)line being a field key line.  Columns may be in any order, and new columns maybe introduced, without hampering ability to read known columns.Known column keys are 'key', 'location', 'qualifiers',and those given below for the prior variant.  Prior variant keys may be discontinued,though 'id', and 'gene'/'symbol' look useful to keep. <p>The prior version of FFF, gnomap-version 1, is used (as of 2000/2001)with <a href="http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/eugenes/">euGenes</a> genome info service. <p>The fields now defined are:<DL COMPACT>  <DT>Feature (col1) </DT>    <DD>  name of feature, usually GenBank/EMBL compatible but generally     whatever the source data has (w/ some minor changes for consistancy among organisms).    Never null.</DD>  <DT>gene (col2) </DT>    <DD>  a name or visible label (should be called 'symbol' instead).  May be null. </DD>  <DT>map (col3)</DT>    <DD>  org. specific map position, cytologic or other.  May be null.</DD>  <DT>range (col4)</DT>    <DD>  phys. map base range for chromosome.     The syntax for this is GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ feature table location. Never null.</DD>  <DT>ID (col5)</DT>    <DD> database id of feature here is MEOW:xxxxx for euGenes database ID. May be null.</DD>  <DT>db_xref (col6)</DT>    <DD>   general collections of database cross-refs.  Minimal set here     as other euGenes data stores these, accessible thru id. May be null.</DD>  <DT>notes (col7)</DT>    <DD>  other info., unstructured. Usually null.</DD></DL><H3>Example format:</H3><PRE># fly/features-2L.tsv# Features for fly from BDGP/Celera/FlyBase data [ 20-December-2000]# gnomap-version 1# Feature gene    map     range                         id                db_xref         source  fly     Chr 2L  1..22082480     -gene    Nhe1    -       complement(98968..101637)       MEOW:FBgn0026787  FlyBase:FBan0012178,GadFly:CT9263       -gene    M(2)21AB -      102694..109351                  MEOW:FBgn0005278  FlyBase:FBan0002674,GadFly:CT31903,GadFly:CT31899,GadFly:CT31907,GadFly:CT31901,GadFly:CT31790  -gene    CG13694 -       complement(110631..111036)      MEOW:FBgn0031219  FlyBase:FBan0013694,GadFly:CT33151      - gene    CG4822  -       complement(111997..115661)      MEOW:FBgn0031220  FlyBase:FBan0004822,GadFly:CT41972,GadFly:CT41960,GadFly:CT41970,GadFly:CT15205 -</PRE>Value '-' or empty field indicates null value. <BR>Leading '#' indicate comment, with only '# gnomap-version' aspecial comment, though I parse the '# Features for fly fromBDGP/Celera/FlyBase data [ 20-December-2000]' comment.<BR>The special 'source' feature, always? the first non-comment, withgene/symbol = organism (e.g. fly/worm/man/weed/...), the map =chromosome, and range = chromosome base range.<P><H3>Next format version:</H3>The current gnomap format is similar to GFF but with, to me, more usefuland efficient combination of fields for maps (among other thingswith GFF one must read a bunch of lines like exons, sort andpaste together for a single mapped feature).<p>The general idea for this gnomap format is to captureall of a DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank feature table statement in oneefficiently parseable line.   Afuture format might require a 'merge' style tab-separated file where the first lineis a set of field keys. These keys would be "Feature","location", plus any set of qualifiers defined the same as D/E/Gqualifier tagset of <Ahref="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/collab/FT/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/collab/FT/</A>, but withsome variation to suit the need for fixed columns. A qualifier field couldbe added/removed from table depending on need.  The parser shouldrecognize first non-comment as a list of field keys.<P>Alternately, the qualifiers could be catenated in a single field, with /key="value" ; /key2="value2" structure.Your comments are welcome. <p><H3>Possible version 2a:</H3><PRE># fly/features-2L.tsv# Features for fly from BDGP/Celera/FlyBase data [ 20-December-2000]# gnomap-version 2aFeature location      gene    map                       id               db_xref                     note   source  1..22082480   fly     Chr 2L   -gene    complement(98968..101637) Nhe1    -             MEOW:FBgn0026787  FlyBase:FBan0012178,GadFly:CT9263       -gene    102694..109351   M(2)21AB -                     MEOW:FBgn0005278  FlyBase:FBan0002674,GadFly:CT31903,GadFly:CT31899,GadFly:CT31907,GadFly:CT31901,GadFly:CT31790  -gene    complement(110631..111036)  CG13694 -           MEOW:FBgn0031219  FlyBase:FBan0013694,GadFly:CT33151      - gene    complement(111997..115661)  CG4822  -           MEOW:FBgn0031220  FlyBase:FBan0004822,GadFly:CT41972,GadFly:CT41960,GadFly:CT41970,GadFly:CT15205 -</PRE><H3>Possible version 2b:</H3><PRE>##gnomap-version 2b# fly/features-2L.fff# Features for fly from BDGP/Celera/FlyBase data [ 20-December-2000]Key    	Location     	Qualifiers                source	1..22082480        	/organism=fly ; /chromosome=2L gene	complement(98968..101637)    /gene=Nhe1 ; id=MEOW:FBgn0026787 ; /db_xref=FlyBase:FBan0012178,GadFly:CT9263   gene   	102694..109351     /gene=M(2)21AB ; /id=MEOW:FBgn0005278 ; /db_xref=FlyBase:FBan0002674,GadFly:CT31903,GadFly:CT31899,GadFly:CT31907,GadFly:CT31901,GadFly:CT31790  -</PRE>(? change format name to FFF - Flattened Feature Format as in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank Feature Table format without newlines and leading spaces :)<p><H3>File sets:</H3>Current <B>feature-xxx.tsv</B> tables consist of one chromosome / linkage-unitof data (there is no 'chromosome' field, see the 'source' feature).
