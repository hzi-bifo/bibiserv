The first line of each sequence entry begins with a greater than  symbol, >.  This is immediately followed by the two character  sequence type specifier.  Space four must contain a semi-colon.  Beginning in space five is the sequence name or identification code  for the NBRF database.  The code is from four to six letters and  numbers.  (See LINE  1).          Specifier             Sequence type              P1                protein, complete              F1                protein, fragment              DL                DNA, linear              DC                DNA, circular              RL                RNA, linear              RC                RNA, circular              N1                functional RNA, other than tRNA              N3                tRNA2.  The second line of each sequence entry contains two kinds of  information.  First is the sequence name which is separated from  the organism or organelle name by the three character sequence  blank space, dash, blank space, " - ".  There is no special  character marking the beginning of this line.  (See LINE  2).3.  Either the amino acid or nucleic acid sequence begins on line three  and can begin in any space, including the first.  The sequence is  free format and may be interrupted by blanks for ease of reading.  Protein sequences man contain special punctuation to indicate  various indeterminacies in the sequence.  In the NBRF data files  all lines may be up to 500 characters long.  However some PSC  programs currently have a limit of 130 characters per line  (including blanks), and BitNet will not accept lines of over eighty  characters.  (See LINE  3, LINE  4, and LINE  5).  The last character in the sequence must be an asterisks, *.                       Example NBRF file LINE  1  :>P1;CBRT LINE  2  :Cytochrome b - Rat mitochondrion (SGC1) LINE  3  :M T N I R K S H P L F K I I N H S F I D L P A P S LINE  4  : VTHICRDVN Y GWL IRY LINE  5  :TWIGGQPVEHPFIIIGQLASISYFSIILILMPISGIVEDKMLKWN*</PRE></BODY></HTML>
