GBREL.TXT          Genetic Sequence Data Bank                         15 June 1999               NCBI-GenBank Flat File Release 112.0                    Distribution Release Notes 4028171 loci,  2974791993 bases, from 4028171 reported sequences  This document describes the format and content of the flat files thatcomprise releases of the GenBank database. If you have any questions orcomments about GenBank or this document, please contact NCBI via emailat info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov or:////3. FILE FORMATS  The flat file examples included in this section, while not always from thecurrent release, are usually quite recent.  Any differences compared to theactual data files are the result of updates to the entries involved.3.1 File Header Information  Each of the seventy files of a GenBank release begins with thesame header, except for the first line, which contains the file name,and the sixth line, which contains the title of the file. The firstline of the file contains the file name in character positions 1 to 9and the full data bank name (Genetic Sequence Data Bank) starting incolumn 20. The brief names of the files in this release are listed insection 2.2.  The second line contains the date of the current release in the form`day month year', beginning in position 26. The fourth line containsthe current GenBank release number. The release number appears inpositions 41 to 45 and consists of two numbers separated by a decimalpoint. The number to the left of the decimal is the major releasenumber. The digit to the right of the decimal indicates the version ofthe major release; it is zero for the first version. The sixth linecontains a title for the file. The eighth line lists the number ofentries (loci), number of bases (or base pairs), and number of reportsof sequences (equal to number of entries in this case). These numbers areright-justified at fixed positions. The number of entries appears inpositions 1 to 7, the number of bases in positions 15 to 23, and thenumber of reports in positions 37 to 40. (There are more reports ofsequences than entries since reported sequences that overlap orduplicate each other are combined into single entries.) The third,fifth, seventh, and ninth lines are blank.1       10        20        30        40        50        60        70       79---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------GBACC.IDX          Genetic Sequence Data Bank                         15 December 1993                 GenBank Flat File Release 80.0                      Accession Number Index  150744 loci, 163802597 bases, from 150744 reported sequences---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------1       10        20        30        40        50        60        70       79Example 1. Sample File Header3.2 Directory Files3.2.1 Short Directory File  The short directory file contains brief descriptions of all of thesequence entries contained in this release. These descriptions are infifteen groups, one group for each of the fifteen sequence entrydata files. The first record at the beginning of a group of entriescontains the name of the group in uppercase characters, beginning inposition 21. The organism groups are PRIMATE, RODENT, OTHER MAMMAL,OTHER VERTEBRATE, INVERTEBRATE, PLANT, BACTERIAL, STRUCTURAL RNA, VIRAL,PHAGE, SYNTHETIC, UNANNOTATED, EXPRESSED SEQUENCE TAG, PATENT, orSEQUENCE TAGGED SITE.  The second record is blank.  Each record in the short directory contains the sequence entry name(LOCUS) in the first 12 positions, followed by a brief definition ofthe sequence beginning in column 13. The definition is truncated (atthe end of a word) to leave room at the right margin for at least onespace, the sequence length, and the letters `bp'. The length of thesequence is printed right-justified to column 77, followed by theletters `bp' in columns 78 and 79. The next-to-last record for a grouphas `ZZZZZZZZZZ' in its first ten positions (where the entry namewould normally appear). The last record is a blank line. An example ofthe short directory file format, showing the descriptions of the lastentries in the Other Vertebrate sequence data file and the firstentries of the Invertebrate sequence data file, is reproduced below:1       10        20        30        40        50        60        70       79---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------ZEFWNT1G3   B.rerio wnt-1 gene (exon 3) for wnt-1 protein.                266bpZEFWNT1G4   B.rerio wnt-1 gene (exon 4) for wnt-1 protein.                647bpZEFZF54     Zebrafish homeotic gene ZF-54.                                246bpZEFZFEN     Zebrafish engrailed-like homeobox sequence.                   327bpZZZZZZZZZZ                    INVERTEBRATEAAHAV33A    Acanthocheilonema viteae pepsin-inhibitor-like-protein       1048bpACAAC01     Acanthamoeba castelani gene encoding actin I.                1571bpACAACTPH    Acanthamoeba castellanii actophorin mRNA, complete cds.       671bpACAMHCA     A.castellanii non-muscle myosin heavy chain gene, partial    5894bp---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------1       10        20        30        40        50        60        70       79Example 2. Short Directory File3.3 Index FilesThere are five files containing indices to the entries in this release: Accession number index file Keyword phrase index file Author name index file Journal citation index file Gene name index file  The index keys (accession numbers, keywords, authors, journals, andgene symbols.) of an index are sorted alphabetically. (The index keysfor the keyword phrases and author names appear in uppercasecharacters even though they appear in mixed case in the sequenceentries.) Under each index key, the names of the sequence entriescontaining that index key are listed alphabetically. Each sequencename is also followed by its data file division and primary accessionnumber. The following codes are used to designate the data filedivisions: 1. PRI - primate sequences 2. ROD - rodent sequences 3. MAM - other mammalian sequences 4. VRT - other vertebrate sequences 5. INV - invertebrate sequences 6. PLN - plant, fungal, and algal sequences 7. BCT - bacterial sequences 8. RNA - structural RNA sequences 9. VRL - viral sequences10. PHG - bacteriophage sequences11. SYN - synthetic sequences12. UNA - unannotated sequences13. EST - EST sequences (expressed sequence tags)14. PAT - patent sequences15. STS - STS sequences (sequence tagged sites)16. GSS - GSS sequences (genome survey sequences)17. HTG - HTGS sequences (high throughput genomic sequences)  The index key begins in column 1 of a record. An 11-character fieldfor the sequence entry name starts in position 14 of a record,followed by a 3-character field for the data file division, startingat position 25 and ending at position 27, and a 6-character field forthe primary accession number, starting at position 29 and ending atposition 34. All entries in the fields are left-justified.  Beginning at positions 36 and 58, the three fields repeat, so threesets of sequence information can appear in one record. If there aremore than three entry names, the next records are used; the index keyis not repeated. For the accession number files, the entry names beginin the same record as the index key, since the key is always less than12 characters. In the other index files, the entry names begin on therecord following the index key record.NOTE: The column positions stated above will be shifted to theright if primary accessions in the 8-character format are present.3.3.1 Accession Number Index File  Accession numbers are unique six character or eight-character alphanumericidentifiers of GenBank database entries. The six-character accessionnumber format consists of a single uppercase letter, followed by 5 digits.The eight-character accession number format consists of two uppercaseletters, followed by 6 digits.  Accessions provide an unchanging identifierfor the data with which they are associated, and we encourage you to citeaccession numbers whenever you refer to data from GenBank.  GenBank entries can have both 'primary' and 'secondary' accessionsassociated with them (see Section 3.5.6).  The following excerpt from the accession number index file illustratesthe format of the index:1       10        20        30        40        50        60        70       79---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------J00316       HUMTBB11P  PRI J00316J00317       HUMTBB46P  PRI J00317J00318       HUMUG1     PRI J00318J00319       HUMUG1PA   PRI J00319J00320       HUMVIPMR1  PRI L00154 HUMVIPMR2  PRI L00155 HUMVIPMR3  PRI L00156             HUMVIPMR4  PRI L00157 HUMVIPMR5  PRI L00158J00321       BABA1AT    PRI J00321J00322       CHPRSA     PRI J00322J00323       AGMRSASPC  PRI J00323J00324       BABATIII   PRI J00324---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------1       10        20        30        40        50        60        70       79Example 4. Accession Number Index File  If the same accession number is found in more than one entry (a resultof the infrequent occasions when a single entry is split into two ormore separate entries), then the additional entries and groups inwhich the number appears are also given. In the example above, J00320is a secondary accession, appearing on 5 other database entries.3.3.2 Keyword Phrase Index File  Keyword phrases consist of names for gene products and othercharacteristics of sequence entries. There are approximately 18,000keyword phrases. An excerpt from the keyword phrase index file isshown below:1       10        20        30        40        50        60        70       79---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------DNA HELICASE             ECOHELIV   BCT J04726 ECOUVRD    BCT X00738 FPLTRAX    BCT M38047             HS2ULL     VRL D10470 HSECOMGEN  VRL M86664 PT4DDA     PHG M93048             SYNPMMB190 SYN M37846 YSPRHP3    PLN X64583DNA HELICASE I             ECOPTRAI5  BCT X57430DNA HELICASE II             ECOUVRD2   BCT D00069 HEAMUTB1A  BCT M99049DNA INVERSION SYSTEM             ECOP15BG   BCT X62121DNA INVERTASE             ECOPIN     BCT K00676 ECOPIN1    BCT X01805 PMUGINMOM  PHG V01463             STABINR3   BCT X16298 STAINVSA   BCT M36694DNA J HEATSHOCK PROTEIN             MSGDNAJHSP BCT M95576DNA LIGASE             ECOLIG     BCT M24278 ECOLIGA    BCT M30255 PT4G30     PHG X00039             PT6LIG55   PHG M38465 TTHDNALGS  BCT M74792 TTHDNALIG  BCT M36417             VACCDNLIG  VRL X16512 VACRHF     VRL D11079 YSCCDC9    PLN X03246             YSPCDC17   PLN X05107 ZMOLIG     BCT Z11910---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------1       10        20        30        40        50        60        70       79Example 5.

Journal Citation Index File3.3.5 Gene Name Index  The /gene qualifiers of many GenBank entries contain values other thanofficial gene symbols, such as the product or the standard name of the gene.Hence, NCBI has chosen to build an index (gbgen.idx) more like a keyword indexfor this field, using both the GenBank /gene qualifier and the 'Gene.locus'fields from the NCBI internal database as keys. An excerpt from the gene nameindex file is shown below:1       10        20        30        40        50        60        70       79---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------SUPPRESSOR OF SABLE             DROSUSG    INV M57889SUPPRESSOR TWO OF ZESTE             DROS2ZSTG  INV X56798SUPRESSOR TWO OF ZESTE             DROS2ZSTM  INV X56799SUR             CHKSRVCNTK VRT M57290SURC             ARFSURCG   BCT X63435---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------1       10        20        30        40        50        60        70       79Example 8. Gene Name Index File3.4 Sequence Entry Files  GenBank releases contain forty-four sequence entry data files, onefor each "division" of GenBank.3.4.1 File Organization  Each of these files has the same format and consists of two parts:header information (described in section 3.1) and sequence entries forthat division (described in the following sections).3.4.2  Entry Organization  In the second portion of a sequence entry file (containing thesequence entries for that division), each record (line) consists oftwo parts. The first part is found in positions 1 to 10 and maycontain:1. A keyword, beginning in column 1 of the record (e.g., REFERENCE isa keyword).2. A subkeyword beginning in column 3, with columns 1 and 2 blank(e.g., AUTHORS is a subkeyword of REFERENCE).3. Blank characters, indicating that this record is a continuation ofthe information under the keyword or subkeyword above it.4. A code, beginning in column 6, indicating the nature of an entry(feature key) in the FEATURES table; these codes are described inSection 3.4.12.1 below.5. A number, ending in column 9 of the record. This number occurs inthe portion of the entry describing the actual nucleotide sequence anddesignates the numbering of sequence positions.6. Two slashes (//) in positions 1 and 2, marking the end of an entry.  The second part of each sequence entry record contains the informationappropriate to its keyword, in positions 13 to 80 for keywords andpositions 11 to 80 for the sequence.  The following is a brief description of each entry field. Detailedinformation about each field may be found in Sections 3.4.4 to 3.4.14.LOCUS   - A short mnemonic name for the entry, chosen to suggest thesequence's definition. Mandatory keyword/exactly one record.DEFINITION      - A concise description of the sequence. Mandatorykeyword/one or more records.ACCESSION       - The primary accession number is a unique, unchangingcode assigned to each entry. (Please use this code when citinginformation from GenBank.) Mandatory keyword/one or more records.VERSION         - A compound identifier consisting of the primaryaccession number and a numeric version number associated with thecurrent version of the sequence data in the record. This is followedby an integer key (a "GI") assigned to the sequence by NCBI.Mandatory keyword/exactly one record.NID             - An alternative method of presenting the NCBI GIidentifier (described above). The NID is obsolete and will soon beremoved from the GenBank flatfile format. Mandatory keyword/exactly onerecord.KEYWORDS        - Short phrases describing gene products and otherinformation about an entry. Mandatory keyword in all annotatedentries/one or more records.SEGMENT - Information on the order in which this entry appears in aseries of discontinuous sequences from the same molecule. Optionalkeyword (only in segmented entries)/exactly one record.SOURCE  - Common name of the organism or the name most frequently usedin the literature. Mandatory keyword in all annotated entries/one ormore records/includes one subkeyword.   ORGANISM     - Formal scientific name of the organism (first line)and taxonomic classification levels (second and subsequent lines).Mandatory subkeyword in all annotated entries/two or more records.REFERENCE       - Citations for all articles containing data reportedin this entry. Includes four subkeywords and may repeat. Mandatorykeyword/one or more records.   AUTHORS      - Lists the authors of the citation. Mandatorysubkeyword/one or more records.   TITLE        - Full title of citation. Optional subkeyword (presentin all but unpublished citations)/one or more records.   JOURNAL      - Lists the journal name, volume, year, and pagenumbers of the citation. Mandatory subkeyword/one or more records.   MEDLINE      - Provides the Medline unique identifier for acitation. Optional subkeyword/one record.   REMARK       - Specifies the relevance of a citation to anentry. Optional subkeyword/one or more records.COMMENT - Cross-references to other sequence entries, comparisons toother collections, notes of changes in LOCUS names, and other remarks.Optional keyword/one or more records/may include blank records.FEATURES        - Table containing information on portions of thesequence that code for proteins and RNA molecules and information onexperimentally determined sites of biological significance. Optionalkeyword/one or more records.BASE COUNT      - Summary of the number of occurrences of each basecode in the sequence. Mandatory keyword/exactly one record.ORIGIN  - Specification of how the first base of the reported sequenceis operationally located within the genome. Where possible, thisincludes its location within a larger genetic map. Mandatorykeyword/exactly one record.        - The ORIGIN line is followed by sequence data (multiple records).//      - Entry termination symbol.

Sample Sequence Data File3.4.4 LOCUS Format  The pieces of information contained in the LOCUS record are alwaysfound in fixed positions. The locus name (or entry name), which isalways ten characters or less, begins in position 13. The locus nameis designed to help group entries with similar sequences: the firstthree characters usually designate the organism; the fourth and fifthcharacters can be used to show other group designations, such as geneproduct; for segmented entries the last character is one of a seriesof sequential integers.  The number of bases or base pairs in the sequence ends in position 29.The letters `bp' are in positions 31 to 32. Positions 34 to 36 givethe number of strands of the sequence. Positions 37 to 40 give thetopology of molecule sequenced. If the sequence is of a special type,a notation (such as `circular') is included in positions 43 to 52.  GenBank sequence entries are divided among fifteen taxonomicdivisions. Each entry's division is identified by a three-letter codein positions 53 to 55. See Section 3.3 for the division codes.  Positions 63 to 73 of the record contain the date the entry wasentered or underwent any substantial revisions, such as the additionof newly published data, in the form dd-MMM-yyyy.The detailed format for the LOCUS record is as follows:Positions       Contents1-12    LOCUS13-22   Locus name23-29   Length of sequence, right-justified31-32   bp34-36   Blank, ss- (single-stranded), ds- (double-stranded), or         ms- (mixed-stranded)37-40   Blank, DNA, RNA, tRNA (transfer RNA), rRNA (ribosomal RNA),        mRNA (messenger RNA), or uRNA (small nuclear RNA)43-52   Blank (implies linear) or circular53-55   The division code (see Section 3.3)63-73   Date, in the form dd-MMM-yyyy (e.g., 15-MAR-1991)3.4.5 DEFINITION Format  The DEFINITION record gives a brief description of the sequence,proceeding from general to specific. It starts with the common name ofthe source organism, then gives the criteria by which this sequence isdistinguished from the remainder of the source genome, such as thegene name and what it codes for, or the protein name and mRNA, or somedescription of the sequence's function (if the sequence isnon-coding). If the sequence has a coding region, the description maybe followed by a completeness qualifier, such as cds (complete codingsequence). There is no limit on the number of lines that may be partof the DEFINITION.  The last line must end with a period.3.4.5.1 DEFINITION Format for NLM Entries  The DEFINITION line for entries derived from journal-scanning at the NLM isan automatically generated descriptive summary that accompanies each DNA andprotein sequence. It contains information derived from fields in a databasethat summarize the most important attributes of the sequence.  The DEFINITIONlines are designed to supplement the accession number and the sequence itselfas a means of uniquely and completely specifying DNA and protein sequences. Thefollowing are examples of NLM DEFINITION lines:NADP-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase [swine, mRNA, 1 gene, 1585 nt]94 kda fiber cell beaded-filament structural protein [rats, lens, mRNAPartial, 1 gene, 1873 nt]inhibin alpha {promoter and exons} [mice, Genomic, 1 gene, 1102 nt, segment1 of 2]cefEF, cefG=acetyl coenzyme A:deacetylcephalosporin C o-acetyltransferase[Acremonium chrysogenum, Genomic, 2 genes, 2639 nt]myogenic factor 3, qmf3=helix-loop-helix protein [Japanese quails,embryo, Peptide Partial, 246 aa]  The first part of the definition line contains information describingthe genes and proteins represented by the molecular sequences.  This canbe gene locus names, protein names and descriptions that replace or augmentactual names.  Gene and gene product are linked by "=".  Any specialidentifying terms are presented within brackets, such as: {promoter},{N-terminal}, {EC 2.13.2.4}, {alternatively spliced}, or {3' region}.  The second part of the definition line is delimited by square brackets, '[]',and provides details about the molecule type and length.  The biologicalsource, i.e., genus and species or common name as cited by the author.Developmental stage, tissue type and strain are included if available.The molecule types include: Genomic, mRNA, Peptide. and Other GenomicMaterial. Genomic molecules are assumed to be partial sequence unless"Complete" is specified, whereas mRNA and peptide molecules are assumedto be complete unless "Partial" is noted.3.4.6 ACCESSION Format  This field contains a series of six-character and/or eight-characteridentifiers called 'accession numbers'. The six-character accessionnumber format consists of a single uppercase letter, followed by 5 digits.The eight-character accession number format consists of two uppercaseletters, followed by 6 digits. The 'primary', or first, of the accessionnumbers occupies positions 13 to 18 (6-character format) or positions13 to 20 (8-character format). Subsequent 'secondary' accession numbers(if present) are separated from the primary, and from each other, by asingle space. In some cases, multiple lines of secondary accessionnumbers might be present, starting at position 13.  The primary accession number of a GenBank entry provides a stable identifierfor the biological object that the entry represents. Accessions do not changewhen the underlying sequence data or associated features change.  Secondary accession numbers arise for a number of reasons. For example, asingle accession number may initially be assigned to a sequence from apublication. If it is later discovered that the sequence must be entered intothe database as multiple entries, each entry would receive a new primaryaccession number, and the original accession number would appear as a secondaryaccession number on each of the new entries.3.4.7 NID Format  This field contains the unique nucleic acid sequence identifier that isassigned by NCBI to the sequence data in a GenBank entry. Nucleic acididentifiers consist of the letter 'g', followed by one or more digits. Thissequence identifier occupies positions 13 and higher.  While accession numbers allow one to retrieve the same biological entryin the database, regardless of changes to that record, the nucleic acididentifier changes every time that the underlying sequence changes. Reasonsfor sequence changes include: the removal of vector contamination, re-sequencingof stretches of ambiguous sequence, and the correction of sequencing errors.  NOTE: NCBI NIDs (also called "GI" identifiers) are now presented via thenew VERSION linetype, hence the NID linetype has become obsolete. It will beremoved from the GenBank flatfile format in late 1999 or early 2000.3.4.8 KEYWORDS Format  The KEYWORDS field does not appear in unannotated entries, but isrequired in all annotated entries. Keywords are separated bysemicolons; a "keyword" may be a single word or a phrase consisting ofseveral words. Each line in the keywords field ends in a semicolon;the last line ends with a period. If no keywords are included in theentry, the KEYWORDS record contains only a period.3.4.9 SEGMENT Format  The SEGMENT keyword is used when two (or more) entries of knownrelative orientation are separated by a short (<10 kb) stretch of DNA.It is limited to one line of the form `n of m', where `n' is thesegment number of the current entry and `m' is the total number ofsegments.3.4.10 SOURCE Format  The SOURCE field consists of two parts. The first part is found afterthe SOURCE keyword and contains free-format information including anabbreviated form of the organism name followed by a molecule type;multiple lines are allowed, but the last line must end with a period.The second part consists of information found after the ORGANISMsubkeyword. The formal scientific name for the source organism (genusand species, where appropriate) is found on the same line as ORGANISM.The records following the ORGANISM line list the taxonomicclassification levels, separated by semicolons and ending with aperiod.3.4.11 REFERENCE Format  The REFERENCE field consists of five parts: the keyword REFERENCE, andthe subkeywords AUTHORS, TITLE (optional), JOURNAL, MEDLINE (optional),and REMARK (optional).  The REFERENCE line contains the number of the particular reference and(in parentheses) the range of bases in the sequence entry reported inthis citation. Additional prose notes may also be found within theparentheses. The numbering of the references does not reflectpublication dates or priorities.  The AUTHORS line lists the authors in the order in which they appearin the cited article. Last names are separated from initials by acomma (no space); there is no comma before the final `and'. The listof authors ends with a period.  The TITLE line is an optional field,although it appears in the majority of entries. It does not appear inunpublished sequence data entries that have been deposited directlyinto the GenBank data bank, the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library,or the DNA Data Bank of Japan. The TITLE field does not end with aperiod.  The JOURNAL line gives the appropriate literature citation for thesequence in the entry. The word `Unpublished' will appear after theJOURNAL subkeyword if the data did not appear in the scientificliterature, but was directly deposited into the data bank. Forpublished sequences the JOURNAL line gives the Thesis, Journal, orBook citation, including the year of publication, the specificcitation, or In press.  The MEDLINE line provides the National Library of Medicine's Medlineunique identifier for a citation (if known). Medline UIs are 8 digitnumbers.  The REMARK line is a textual comment that specifies the relevanceof the citation to the entry.3.4.12 FEATURES Format  GenBank releases use a feature table format designed jointly byGenBank, the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library, and the DNA DataBank of Japan. This format is in use by all three databases. Themost complete and accurate Feature Table documentation can be foundon the Web at:        http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/collab/FT/index.html  The Feature Table specification is also available as a printeddocument: `The DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank Feature Table: Definition'. ContactGenBank at the address shown on the first page of these Release Notesif you would like a copy.  The feature table contains information about genes and gene products,as well as regions of biological significance reported in thesequence. The feature table contains information on regions of thesequence that code for proteins and RNA molecules. It also enumeratesdifferences between different reports of the same sequence, andprovides cross-references to other data collections, as described inmore detail below.  The first line of the feature table is a header that includes thekeyword `FEATURES' and the column header `Location/Qualifier.' Eachfeature consists of a descriptor line containing a feature key and alocation (see sections below for details). If the location does notfit on this line, a continuation line may follow. If furtherinformation about the feature is required, one or more linescontaining feature qualifiers may follow the descriptor line.  The feature key begins in column 6 and may be no more than 15characters in length. The location begins in column 22. Featurequalifiers begin on subsequent lines at column 22. Location,qualifier, and continuation lines may extend from column 22 to 80.  Feature tables are required, due to the mandatory presence of thesource feature. The sections below provide a brief introduction tothe feature table format.3.4.12.1 Feature Key Names  The first column of the feature descriptor line contains the featurekey. It starts at column 6 and can continue to column 20. The list ofvalid feature keys is shown below.  Remember, the most definitive documentation for the feature table canbe found at:        http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/collab/FT/index.htmlallele          Related strain contains alternative gene formattenuator      Sequence related to transcription terminationC_region        Span of the C immunological featureCAAT_signal     `CAAT box' in eukaryotic promotersCDS             Sequence coding for amino acids in protein (includes                stop codon)conflict        Independent sequence determinations differD-loop          Displacement loopD_segment       Span of the D immunological featureenhancer        Cis-acting enhancer of promoter functionexon            Region that codes for part of spliced mRNAgene            Region that defines a functional gene, possibly                including upstream (promotor, enhancer, etc)                and downstream control elementsGC_signal       `GC box' in eukaryotic promotersiDNA            Intervening DNA eliminated by recombinationintron          Transcribed region excised by mRNA splicingJ_region        Span of the J immunological featureLTR             Long terminal repeatmat_peptide     Mature peptide coding region (does not include stop codon)misc_binding    Miscellaneous binding sitemisc_difference Miscellaneous difference featuremisc_feature    Region of biological significance that cannot be described                by any other featuremisc_recomb     Miscellaneous recombination featuremisc_RNA        Miscellaneous transcript feature not defined by other RNA keysmisc_signal     Miscellaneous signalmisc_structure  Miscellaneous DNA or RNA structuremodified_base   The indicated base is a modified nucleotidemRNA            Messenger RNAmutation        A mutation alters the sequence hereN_region        Span of the N immunological featureold_sequence    Presented sequence revises a previous versionpolyA_signal    Signal for cleavage & polyadenylationpolyA_site      Site at which polyadenine is added to mRNAprecursor_RNA   Any RNA species that is not yet the mature RNA productprim_transcript Primary (unprocessed) transcriptprimer          Primer binding region used with PCRprimer_bind     Non-covalent primer binding sitepromoter        A region involved in transcription initiationprotein_bind    Non-covalent protein binding site on DNA or RNARBS             Ribosome binding siterep_origin      Replication origin for duplex DNArepeat_region   Sequence containing repeated subsequencesrepeat_unit     One repeated unit of a repeat_regionrRNA            Ribosomal RNAS_region        Span of the S immunological featuresatellite       Satellite repeated sequencescRNA           Small cytoplasmic RNAsig_peptide     Signal peptide coding regionsnRNA           Small nuclear RNAsource          Biological source of the sequence data represented by                a GenBank record.

The location descriptorbegins at position 22. Several conventions are used to indicatesequence location.  Base numbers in location descriptors refer to numbering in the entry,which is not necessarily the same as the numbering scheme used in thepublished report. The first base in the presented sequence is numberedbase 1. Sequences are presented in the 5 to 3 direction.Location descriptors can be one of the following:1. A single base;2. A contiguous span of bases;3. A site between two bases;4. A single base chosen from a range of bases;5. A single base chosen from among two or more specified bases;6. A joining of sequence spans;7. A reference to an entry other than the one to which the featurebelongs (i.e., a remote entry), followed by a location descriptorreferring to the remote sequence;8. A literal sequence (a string of bases enclosed in quotation marks).  A site between two residues, such as an endonuclease cleavage site, isindicated by listing the two bases separated by a carat (e.g., 23^24).  A single residue chosen from a range of residues is indicated by thenumber of the first and last bases in the range separated by a singleperiod (e.g., 23.79). The symbols < and > indicate that the end pointof the range is beyond the specified base number.  A contiguous span of bases is indicated by the number of the first andlast bases in the range separated by two periods (e.g., 23..79). Thesymbols < and > indicate that the end point of the range is beyond thespecified base number. Starting and ending positions can be indicatedby base number or by one of the operators described below.  Operators are prefixes that specify what must be done to the indicatedsequence to locate the feature. The following are the operatorsavailable, along with their most common format and a description.complement (location): The feature is complementary to the locationindicated. Complementary strands are read 5 to 3.join (location, location, .. location): The indicated elements shouldbe placed end to end to form one contiguous sequence.order (location, location, .. location): The elements are found in thespecified order in the 5 to 3 direction, but nothing is implied aboutthe rationality of joining them.group (location, location, .. location): The elements are related andshould be grouped together, but no order is implied.one-of (location, location, .. location): The element can be any one,but only one, of the items listed.3.4.12.3  Feature Qualifiers  Qualifiers provide additional information about features. They takethe form of a slash (/) followed by a qualifier name and, ifapplicable, an equal sign (=) and a qualifier value. Featurequalifiers begin at column 22.Qualifiers convey many types of information. Their values can,therefore, take several forms:1. Free text;2. Controlled vocabulary or enumerated values;3. Citations or reference numbers;4. Sequences;5. Feature labels.  Text qualifier values must be enclosed in double quotation marks. Thetext can consist of any printable characters (ASCII values 32-126decimal). If the text string includes double quotation marks, each setmust be `escaped' by placing a double quotation mark in front of it(e.g., /note="This is an example of ""escaped"" quotation marks").  Some qualifiers require values selected from a limited set of choices.For example, the `/direction' qualifier has only three values `left,'`right,' or `both.' These are called controlled vocabulary qualifiervalues. Controlled qualifier values are not case sensitive; they canbe entered in any combination of upper- and lowercase without changingtheir meaning.  Citation or published reference numbers for the entry should beenclosed in square brackets ([]) to distinguish them from othernumbers.  A literal sequence of bases (e.g., "atgcatt") should be enclosed inquotation marks. Literal sequences are distinguished from free text bycontext. Qualifiers that take free text as their values do not takeliteral sequences, and vice versa.  The `/label=' qualifier takes a feature label as its qualifier.Although feature labels are optional, they allow unambiguousreferences to the feature. The feature label identifies a featurewithin an entry; when combined with the accession number and the nameof the data bank from which it came, it is a unique tag for thatfeature. Feature labels must be unique within an entry, but can be thesame as a feature label in another entry. Feature labels are not casesensitive; they can be entered in any combination of upper-andlowercase without changing their meaning.The following is a list of valid feature qualifiers./anticodon      Location of the anticodon of tRNA and the amino acidfor which it codes/bound_moiety   Moiety bound/citation       Reference to a citation providing the claim of orevidence for a feature/codon          Specifies a codon that is different from any found in thereference genetic code/codon_start    Indicates the first base of the first complete codonin a CDS (as 1 or 2 or 3)/cons_splice    Identifies intron splice sites that do not conform tothe 5'-GT...

When such a cross-reference appears in an entrythat contains a gene coding for a transfer RNA molecule, it refers tothe code in the tRNA gene compilation. Similar cross-references inentries containing mature transfer RNA sequences refer to thecompanion compilation of tRNA sequences published by D.H. Gauss and M.Sprinzl in Nucleic Acids Research.3.4.12.5 Feature Table Examples  In the first example a number of key names, feature locations, andqualifiers are illustrated, taken from different sequences. The firsttable entry is a coding region consisting of a simple span of basesand including a /gene qualifier. In the second table entry, an NARcross-reference is given (see the previous section for a discussion ofthese cross-references). The third and fourth table entries use thesymbols `<`and `>' to indicate that the beginning or end of thefeature is beyond the range of the presented sequence. In the fifthtable entry, the symbol `^' indicates that the feature is betweenbases.1       10        20        30        40        50        60        70       79---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------     CDS             5..1261                     /product="alpha-1-antitrypsin precursor"                     /map="14q32.1"                     /gene="PI"     tRNA            1..87                     /note="Leu-tRNA-CAA (NAR: 1057)"                     /anticodon=(pos:35..37,aa:Leu)     mRNA            1..>66                     /note="alpha-1-acid glycoprotein mRNA"     transposon      <1..267                     /note="insertion element IS5"     misc_recomb     105^106                     /note="B.subtilis DNA end/IS5 DNA start"     conflict        258                     /replace="t"                     /citation=[2]---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------1       10        20        30        40        50        60        70       79Example 10.

Joining Sequences3.4.13 ORIGIN Format  The ORIGIN record may be left blank, may appear as `Unreported.' ormay give a local pointer to the sequence start, usually involving anexperimentally determined restriction cleavage site or the geneticlocus (if available). The ORIGIN record ends in a period if itcontains data, but does not include the period if the record is leftempty (in contrast to the KEYWORDS field which contains a periodrather than being left blank).3.4.14 SEQUENCE Format  The nucleotide sequence for an entry is found in the records followingthe ORIGIN record. The sequence is reported in the 5 to 3 direction.There are sixty bases per record, listed in groups of ten basesfollowed by a blank, starting at position 11 of each record. Thenumber of the first nucleotide in the record is given in columns 4 to9 (right justified) of the record.
