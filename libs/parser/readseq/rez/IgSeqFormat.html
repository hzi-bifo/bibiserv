The first line in a sequence file is a comment line.  This line  begins with a semi-colon in the first space.  This line need  not be present.  If it is present it holds descriptive text.  There may be as many comment lines as desired at the first of  sequence file.  (See LINE  1).2.  The second line must be present and contains an identifier or  name for the sequence in the first ten spaces.  (See LINE  2).3.  The sequence begins on the third line and occupies up to eighty  spaces.  Spaces may be included in the sequence for ease of  reading.  The sequence continues for as many line as needed  and is terminated with a 1 or 2.  1 indicates a linear sequence  while 2 marks a circular sequence.  (See LINE  3 and LINE  4).                          Example MolGen/Stanford fileLINE  1  :;  Describe the sequence any way you wantLINE  2  :ECTRNAGLY2LINE  3  :ACGCACGTAC ACGTACGTAC   A C G T C C G T ACG TAC GTA CGTLINE  4  :  GCTTA   GG G C T A1</PRE></BODY></HTML>
